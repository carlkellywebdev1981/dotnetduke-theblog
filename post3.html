             <h2>Holiday To Corfu</h2>
              <p>Corfu is one of the seven gorgeously green and lush Ionian Islands in the turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea, just beyond the coast of Greece. Nicknamed the ‘Emerald Isle’ Corfu is a contender for the lushest Greek island, thanks to its endless olive groves, tree-topped hills and thick fauna.
                As a versatile island destination, Corfu is equally popular with families, couples and party people, with a resort to suit everyone’s holiday needs. Sidari offers fun in spades, while Corfu Town is a must visit for those who want to experience a seamless merging of the cultural and the cosmopolitan. Of course, for those who want to let their hair down on a Corfu package holiday, Kavos is the place to find the very best parties on the island, and Arillas is the ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle of the larger towns.
                Top Resorts and Hotels
                For holidaymakers that are looking for a lively spot on the island, Sidari makes a great choice for affordable holidays to Corfu. You’ll find a family friendly, soft sand beach, leading gently into shallow waters, hidden coves and an exciting nightlife. Whether you want to bar-hop till the early hours, have a traditional pint, or enjoy a long, leisurely meal in a taverna, Sidari has it all. Take a look at the Paradise Apartments for one of the best rated Thomas Cook hotels offering fantastic value for money.
                If you’re looking for amazing nightlife first and foremost - with a great beach to boot - Kavos is the place to find all-night bars and neon-soaked nightclubs. The Trabukos Beach Complex and the Kouryiannos Studios and Rooms are two Club 18-30 hotels positioned slap bang on the beach and within a stones throw of the hottest nightspots – all this at unbelievably low prices, with holidays starting from just £192pp. You can find lots more information about Kavos in our full Kavos destination guide.
                Wherever you choose to base yourself in Corfu, a trip to Corfu Town should be high up on your excursions list. In the Old Town you can wander the crumbling Venetian buildings, marvel at colourful churches and browse the narrow alleyways lined with over-flowing shops and stalls. Foodies will be in heaven here – you can sip fresh coffee on the promenade, sample the local wild honey and fig cakes, or book into one of the town’s gourmet restaurants.
                If you’ve chosen Sidari as your destination, exploring the rock flanked turquoise coves is a must. The Canal d’Amour beach is one of the most romantic spots on the island, with almost pea-green waters for you to enjoy. Thinking of Kassiopi instead? Head to the lively harbour and sample their incredible wine festival this summer.
                Active types will be in their element on Corfu and Ionian coast holidays, as this island’s landscape has much more to offer than just soft sands. Lace up your boots and hike the Corfu trail from Acharavi, wander the green cliff paths or head out to sea at Dassia Beach to explore one of the best scuba diving spots on the island.
                The peak summer months of June, July, August and September are hot and dry on Corfu and the Ionian coast, with typically Greek temperatures of around 30ºC. May and October offer perfect conditions for those with young children or those who don’t like strong sunshine – with warm days, little rain and temperatures at around the 24ºC mark.
                During the winter months the mercury hovers at around 15°C, making out of season Corfu holidays ideal for those who want to get active exploring the lush landscape of the Emerald Isle.
